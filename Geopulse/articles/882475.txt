Preview: Purdue at Penn State
Penn State is still searching for itsfirst Big Ten win four games into the conference season, and the next shotcomes Saturday when it welcomes Purdue into the Bryce Jordan Center. One of theprime culprits in the slow start has been the Nittany Lions long-range shootingaccuracy. Penn State scored a season-high 46 points in the paint in Tuesdays76-73 loss at Indiana but hit only 4-of-24 from 3-point range and is nowshooting 25.3 percent from beyond the arc in Big Ten play.We cant keep shooting so poorly fromthe outside, Penn State coach Patrick Chambers said in his post-game pressconference Tuesday. Weve got to put the ball inside.  Now, when you getdown, youre going to shoot a little bit, take more threes because youre down.So I think 24s a little skewed, but I wanted to put the ball inside. Purdue got off to a 2-0 Big Ten start but has dropped its last twocontests, falling to nationally-ranked Wisconsin (62-55) and Maryland (69-60)last week.
