Fitch: New Bank Operational Risk Method May Boost Comparability
(The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, November 18 (Fitch) The Basel Committee's proposed overhaul of the way  banks calculate how much capital they need to cover operational risk should  result in simpler, more standardised charges, allowing for greater  comparability, says Fitch Ratings. Banks have been calculating operational risk  capital requirements for over 10 years since the implementation of Basel II, but  in many cases capital set aside proved inadequate to cover substantial losses  arising from misconduct fines, controls failure or fraud, for example.  The Basel Committee's update on post-crisis reforms, presented to the G20  leaders at the recent Antalya summit, confirms that it is considering  eliminating the use of internal models to calculate operational risk capital  charges. Basel II introduced several methods for calculating operational risks  to reflect particular risk profiles across banks, variations in operating  environment and management practices. But we believe flexibility has confused  market participants and contributed to a lack of transparency.  The Basel Committee is considering replacing all current approaches with a  single new standardised measurement approach (SMA), and will open a one-year  consultation period by end-2015. SMA will borrow from the current advanced  measurement approach (AMA) by incorporating a requirement for banks to continue  to collect operational risk loss data, but internal modelling will not be used  to determine appropriate capital levels. Comparing operational risk capital  charges currently set aside by banks using AMA has proved difficult, largely  because internal models are highly complex, methodologies vary from bank to bank  and calculation outputs lack transparency.  Some Basel II methods for calculating operational risk charges are predetermined  by regulators, such as the basic indicator and standardised approaches, both of  which link capital charges to gross income (the standardised approach allows  banks to vary multipliers across business lines and units). But operational risk  capital charges can also be calculated using an internal measurement approach  where banks draw on data from their internal operational loss experiences. The  Basel Committee, which is already driving a trend to reduce reliance on complex  models in other areas, says it will consult on removing the AMA. The AMA gave  banks the greatest amount of freedom to set operational risk charges, as  flexibility on the modelling approach meant risk charges would differ even when  applied to the same base data.  We expect operational risk to rise as banks increasingly rely on technology,  heightening exposure to systems failure and cyber attacks. Banks also face  growing compliance and regulatory risks and the overhang of unresolved  litigation is still considerable in some markets.
