U&-&S&-& natgas futures up over 2 pct before storage report
Oct 29 U&-&S&-& natural gas futures climbed higher on Thursday before the government issues the weekly storage report on forecasts for cooler but still well above normal temperatures over the next two weeks. On its first day as the front-month, November futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 5 cents, or 2&@&18 percent, to $2&@&348 per million British thermal units at 10:25 a&-&m&-& EDT (1425 GMT).     The U&-&S&-& Energy Information Administration will release its storage report at 10:30 a&-&m&-& EDT on Thursday.     Analysts forecast utilities added 69 billion cubic feet in the week ended Oct&*& 23. That compares an increase of 81 bcf in the prior week, 88 bcf in the same week a year ago and a five-year average of 73 bcf.      Traders noted the percentage change for the front-month was over 14 percent, the biggest percentage gain in five years, because that change reflected the difference between the November contract, which expired on Wednesday after a sharp downward spiral earlier this week, and the December contract, which is the new front-month.     With the recent sharp declines and increases in the front-month, implied volatility, a component used to price options, climbed to its highest in eight months.     Among the most active options on Thursday were the December 2015 puts with a $1&@&95, $2 and $2&@&10 strike price. <0#NGOPav+> With European and U&-&S&-& weather models both calling for slightly cooler, but still well above-normal temperatures, heating demand for residential, commercial and industrial customers remained much lower than usual for this time of year.     Only the power sector continues to use more gas than usual because that fuel is relatively cheaper than coal.
