Report sheds light on complexity of Spain's indebted Abengoa
MADRID Dec 3 Spanish power and engineering group Abengoa, in pre-insolvency talks to avoid becoming Spain's largest ever bankruptcy, has stakes in almost 900 subsidiaries and partnerships, a report said on Thursday.
The complexity of Abengoa highlights the difficulty faced by creditors of the Seville-based renewable energy firm to understand the extent of its debts, one of the first tasks they face as they embark on restructuring talks.
Almost a quarter of the 887 firms Abengoa has indirect or direct holdings in did not post any income over the last year, Spanish consultancy Informa D&B said in a report, sourced from their database of Spanish firms.
Almost half of them were located abroad, as it operates power projects all over the world. Abengoa also has a listed-subsidiary in the United States, Abengoa Yield, and big operations in Latin America.
Abengoa has so far declared 9 billion euros ($9&@&77 billion) of debt, but a source familiar with the company's finances told Reuters in September that creditors had a total financial exposure to the company of 20&@&2 billion euros.
Informa said only Abengoa and eight other Spanish companies, out of the 2,314 in its database, had holdings in over 500 firms.
