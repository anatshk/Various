DUBAI Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has called Donald Trump a disgrace to the United States following his call for a ban on Muslims entering the country, and demanded the Republican front-runner withdraw from the U&-&S&-& presidential race.
Trump triggered an international uproar when he made his comments in response to last week's deadly shootings in California by two Muslims who authorities said were radicalized&$&.You are a disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America," Prince Alwaleed, the chairman of Kingdom Holding 4280. SE , said on his Twitter account, addressing Trump and referring to the Republican Party&$&.Withdraw from the U. S presidential race as you will never win," the prince added.
Within hours, Trump's response came back, also on Twitter&$&.Dopey Prince @Alwaleed_Talal wants to control our U&-&S&-& politicians with daddy’s money," he said&$&.Can’t do it when I get elected&$&.
Trump's comments have already cost him business in the Middle East, with a major chain of department stores halting sales of his glitzy "Trump Home" line of lamps, mirrors and jewellery boxes.
On Thursday, Dubai real estate firm Damac, which is building a $6 billion golf complex with Trump, stripped the property of his name and image.
Prince Alwaleed, a nephew of Saudi Arabia's King Salman, has holdings in a number of international companies, including Twitter and Citigroup. In July he said he will donate $32 billion to charity in coming years via Alwaleed Philanthropies.
