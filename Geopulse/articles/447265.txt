MLB Team Report - Chicago White Sox - INSIDE PITCH
CLEVELAND -- In what may or may not have been his last start in a Chicago White Sox uniform, Jeff Samardzija gave prospective trade deadline shoppers an eyeful, pitching eight strong innings in an 8-1 win over Cleveland on Thursday night. These are not uncharted waters for the 30-year-old right-hander.
A year ago this month, Samardzija was traded by the Cubs to Oakland in a deal that was made by the A's with an eye toward reaching the postseason. One year later, Chicago's other team, the White Sox, mired in last place in the American League's Central Division, may choose to trade Samardzija to a contender in exchange for a prospect or two.
Samardzija is mindful of all that peripheral noise, but he says he's trying to remain focused on the task at hand&$&.All I can do is go out there and try to increase my value," he said&$&.The better I pitch, the more teams will want me and the more the White Sox will get for me&$&.
After an offseason of making multiple roster-altering moves, the White Sox had hoped to be in the race for a postseason berth this season, but even with their win Thursday, they remain extreme longshots to climb back into the wildcard picture&$&.Having gone through this last year, I realize that it's out of my hands. I just have to go out and play the game in the situation that I'm in," said Samardzija.
In 20 starts for the White Sox, Samardzija is 7-5 with a 3&@&91 ERA. His name is being mentioned prominently as the rumor mill heats up with the approach of the trade deadline. He could conceivably get one more start before the July 31 deadline. That would come on July 28 at Boston.
Asked if he expected to be traded, Samardzija said, "I haven't heard anything, so I have no opinion on that. But I understand this is a business, and how it works. I've enjoyed my time here, but unfortunately things haven't worked out for us the way we planned the last three months&$&.
