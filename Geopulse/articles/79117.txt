BERLIN German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said on Saturday that there were still difficulties ahead for Syria despite the United Nations Security Council having approved a resolution endorsing an international road map for a Syria peace process.
Speaking at a joint news conference with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Berlin after returning from the U&-&N&-& meeting, Steinmeier said: "Neither of us underestimate the difficulties and obstacles that still need to be overcome in defusing the civil war in Syria&$&.
Steinmeier did not elaborate, but obstacles to ending the nearly five-year civil war, where no side is able to secure a clear military victory, include that major powers are bitterly divided on who may represent the opposition as well as on the future of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
The resolution, which Wang said was "very balanced", gives a U&-&N&-& blessing to a plan negotiated in Vienna that calls for a ceasefire, talks between the Syrian government and opposition, and a roughly two-year timeline to create a unity government and hold elections.
The resolution foresees the first talks beginning in January.
