UPDATE 1-S. Korea's SK Group says to invest $39 bln in semiconductor production
(Adds details)
SEOUL Aug 17 South Korea's SK Group is considering investing 46 trillion won ($38&@&9 billion) in semiconductor production facilities, the country's third-largest conglomerate said on Monday, without giving further details.
Analysts say it takes roughly 14-15 trillion won to build one semiconductor plant, including equipment and production systems.
The investment includes new equipment for a production line being built for unit SK Hynix Inc, besides two new semiconductor plants, the group said in a statement.
It did not, however, give details of where the two new plants would be built and when they would start production.
A spokesman for SK Hynix said 2&@&38 trillion won out of the total amount under consideration has already been invested for a plant, called M14, that is under construction in Icheon, about 50 kilometres (31&@&07 miles) from capital Seoul.
He said the plant is expected to be operational "very soon" and would produce about 5,000 dynamic random-access memory chip wafers by year-end.
The announcement comes after President Park Geun-hye last week pardoned SK Group's chairman, Chey Tae-won, jailed since January 2013 in one of the longest jail terms ever given to the head of a South Korean conglomerate.
