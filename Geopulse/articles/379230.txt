MLB Team Report - St&*& Louis Cardinals - INSIDE PITCH
PHOENIX -- The St&*& Louis Cardinals set the tone for their 9-1 victory over Arizona two batters into the game Tuesday, and the Diamondbacks never recovered.
Matt Carpenter walked to lead off a four-run first inning. He charged to third base on what appeared to be a routine single by Tommy Pham to medium-deep right field that Yasmany Tomas fielded while moving toward the infield. Carpenter beat the throw at third, and Pham never hesitated in taking second. Both scored on Jason Heyward's single two batters later.
The two reprised the effort in the fourth inning, when Carpenter was hit by a pitch and Pham followed with another single to right. This time, Carpenter made third easily and Pham cruised into second when Tomas' throw went over the cutoff man. Both scored again.
It is the Cardinals' way&$&.We love that aggressiveness," St&*& Louis manager Mike Matheny said&$&.The aggressiveness of taking a base, whether it is a stolen base or an extra base on a ball hit into the outfield. Those sort of things we've been really talking about a lot since spring training and trying to make a little difference in the little things we can do to put pressure on the defense and the pitching staff&$&.
Carpenter appeared to be pushing the envelope in the first inning, when a good throw might have caught him.
That is fine&$&.We like that," Matheny said&$&.You know what? (If) he's out, you're going to see us over there high-fiving him. There is always that saying about not the first or third out at third base. And we get that. Especially early in the game, we have an opportunity to set the tone. We have the opportunity for a big inning. For me, his aggressiveness allowed us to do that&$&.It may be looked down upon from people on the outside, but not from us. We want pushing the envelope, and Tommy thinking two right out of the box allowed a couple of runs to happen in both situations&$&.

RECORD: 80-45
STREAK: Won three
NEXT: Cardinals (RHP John Lackey, 10-8, 2&@&99 ERA) at Diamondbacks (LHP Patrick Corbin, 3-3, 4&@&09 ERA)
PLAYER NOTES:
--LHP Jaime Garcia improved his career record to 5-0 against Arizona when he gave up one run and four hits in six innings during a 9-1 victory Tuesday. He batted before he threw a pitch, usually a pretty good sign, as the Cardinals batted around in a four-run first inning&$&.We were talking about that the other day -- it's a good feeling when you get to hit in the first inning," Garcia said&$&.It means something good is happening. It's always good to score runs&$&. Garcia is 3-0 at Chase Field and 2-0 at Busch Stadium against Arizona. He has given up three runs in 16 2/3 innings at Chase.
--2B Kolten Wong singled, doubled and drove in the final run in a four-run first inning Tuesday in his return to the lineup after two days off, much of it spent working on his stroke. He entered in an 1-for-19 skid&$&.A couple of good at-bats," Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said&$&.The first one, real short with a guy on base. Not doing too much, taking what they are giving him. A hard hit ball that gives him an RBI. Every one of those just builds for that next opportunity&$&.
--3B Matt Carpenter walked, was hit by a pitch and scored twice in the first four innings. He was hit in the right elbow and replaced in the sixth inning&$&.It hit him in a bad spot," said Cardinals manager Mike Matheny, who indicated the injury did not appear to be serious.
--CF Peter Bourjos broke out of an 0-for-20 skid with a pinch-hit home run in the seventh inning for the final run of a 9-1 win at Arizona&$&.A little confidence -- that's what everybody out here needs," manager Mike Matheny said when asked what he hoped the homer would give Bourjos&$&.Peter has been really everything we could ask him to be in the situation he's been in this year. The consummate pro. Doing whatever we've asked of him. It's nice to be able to get in there and do something&$&. Bourjos, a native of Phoenix, remained in the game and tracked down a well-hit ball in right-center field for the second out of the ninth inning.
--CF Tommy Pham had two singles and a triple and scored three times while recording his second three-hit game in the past four days. Both of Pham's singles in the first and fourth inning came with a runner on first base, and both times he hit the hole between first and second&$&.Good situation hitting," St&*& Louis manager Mike Matheny said&$&.Not trying to do too much. Taking what they are giving him. He's a strong kid. He has good bat speed, a short compact speed&$&. Pham had his first career three-hit game Saturday in San Diego.
QUOTE TO NOTE: "This is a tough ballpark to pitch in, and they have a really good lineup over there. They have some of the best hitters in the league going. It's always a tough challenge for me. A lot of preparation that went into it. I was able to keep us in the ball game&$&. -- LHP Jaime Garcia, after pitching the Cardinals to a 9-1 win over the Diamondbacks on Tuesday.
