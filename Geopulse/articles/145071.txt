Fitch: Pressure Remains on China's Drug Distributors to Consolidate
(The following statement was released by the rating agency) SHANGHAI, November 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings expects the consolidation in China's  drug distribution sector to continue after the implementation of new standards  to ensure quality and safety in the industry, with the next round of  consolidation likely to be driven by the gradual exit of small, less-competitive  players during a policy-driven downturn. Large, leading players will be able to  expand their market share due to their advantages of greater geographical and  product diversification, and increasing economies of scale.  Recent industry consolidation has been mainly driven by implementation of the  new version of the Good Supply Practice (GSP) for Pharmaceutical Products that  the Ministry of Health published in 2013. The new GSP, which will be fully  implemented by the end of 2015, imposes higher transportation and storage  standards for drug distribution. It has prompted small distributors that cannot  afford to make the necessary upgrades to exit the industry.  The pharmaceutical distribution sector in China remains fragmented despite the  wave of exits by smaller companies. The top 100 Chinese drug distributors held a  combined 66% of the market, while the top three companies held 31% in 2014,  according to the Ministry of Commerce. In contrast, about 90% of the U&-&S&-& drug  distribution market is controlled by the top three distributors, according to  the U&-&S&-& National Association of Wholesale Distributors.  Fitch believes further consolidation is inevitable, mainly driven by China's  reform of the healthcare sector. One objective of the reform is to control drug  retail prices, which can be as much as 4-6 times their ex-factory prices in  China. Provincial health authorities have been cutting drug prices in each round  of tender, resulting in margin erosion for both drug manufacturers and  distributors. We believe drug distributors' profit margins will deteriorate further during the  healthcare reform as their bargaining power against manufacturers and hospitals  is not strong. The thinner margins will push small, less-competitive  distributors to exit the industry or merge with larger companies, although this  process may be gradual. The larger distributors will benefit from better economies of scale, enhanced  brand awareness, and greater bargaining power with drug manufacturers. For  example, Sinopharm Group Company has acquired more than 80 regional or  county-level drug distributors since its IPO in 2009, significantly boosting its  market share in nationwide drug distribution from about 10% in 2009 to 17% in  2013. The company's operating margin for its drug distribution segment increased  steadily to 3&@&7% in 2014 from 3&@&3% in 2010, outperforming the decline in the  industry's average profit margin.
