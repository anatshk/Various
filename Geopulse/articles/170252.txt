PANAMA CITY Panama's top court threw out an injunction bid by an infrastructure firm owned by Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, upholding an asset seizure order in a dispute over a power plant, court documents provided by his opponent showed.
The Panama unit of Slim's Ideal SAB de CV has been in a legal battle with Panamanian businessman Julio Cesar Lisac for several years over the ownership of a concession to operate the Bajo de Mina hydroelectric plant.
According to documents provided to Reuters by Lisac on Friday, the latest ruling by Panama's Supreme Court, dated Aug&*& 31, threw out an injunction granted by a lower court, upholding a seizure order from November.
The court did not respond to a request for comment.
The plant concession was first granted to Lisac in 2006, but authorities revoked it and awarded it to Slim. A 2010 Supreme Court ruling in favor of Lisac was never executed.
A spokesman for Slim's Ideal did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
