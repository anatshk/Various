Preview: Padres at Diamondbacks
The San Diego Padres haven't recorded back-to-back victories since the first week of June and take another stab at doing so when they visit the Arizona Diamondbacks in Sunday's finale of a three-game set. San Diego won for only the second time in seven games when it rolled to an 8-1 thumping of the Diamondbacks on Saturday.
The eight runs represent the most for the Padres since a 9-7 victory over Cincinnati on June 6 â€” the final victory of a four-game winning streak before a downslide that resulted in the firing of manager Bud Black. Shortstop Clint Barmes notched his second three-hit game of the season and had two RBIs to pace Friday's 10-hit attack. Arizona has won six of its last nine games and Saturday's loss prevented the Diamondbacks from reaching the &#&500 mark for the first time since an 8-8 start. The Diamondbacks have scored just one run in three of their past five games.
