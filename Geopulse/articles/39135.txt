ANKARA Turkey's foreign minister said on Thursday it would be unrealistic to expect all problems to be solved with Russia after a single meeting, but it was important to maintain open communication channels, state broadcaster TRT reported Thursday, following the Turkish downing last week of a Russian jet.
Mevlut Cavusoglu met Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of an international meeting in Belgrade, in the first high level face-to-face contact since the incident, which has seen Moscow announce a raft of punitive sanctions in response.
