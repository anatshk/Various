Shanghai stocks, which have plunged more than 40 percent since mid-June, were down about 1 percent on Monday, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  shed 0&@&4 percent and was on track for a fall of about 10 percent this month.
Shares in Belgian insurance company Ageas rose about 3 percent after it said on Sunday it had agreed to sell its Hong Kong insurance unit to China-based asset manager JD Capital for $1&@&4 billion, exiting a business it acquired eight years ago.
