MLB Team Report - Arizona Diamondbacks - INSIDE PITCH
DENVER -- Rain never let up Tuesday, causing the Colorado Rockies to postpone their game with the Arizona Diamondbacks about 1 hour, 40 minutes before it was due to start.
The teams also were rained out at Coors Field on Monday.
The Rockies and Diamondbacks will try to play a regular doubleheader Wednesday, when wet weather is again forecast. There were discussions about playing another doubleheader Sept. 1 to make up the game postponed Monday.
Both the Rockies and Diamondbacks will stay with their scheduled rotation and hope their starters can adapt to unusually long layoffs.
Arizona right-hander Josh Collmenter, who limited the Rockies to one unearned run in eight innings April 29 at Chase Field in a 9-1 win, will pitch Wednesday's opener on six days of rest.
"It's got to be hard," Diamondbacks manager Chip Hale said, "but Colly's the guy I think we feel comfortable with being able to handle it the best. He is just so easygoing and can make adjustments on the fly, so we think he's OK doing this."
Left-hander Robbie Ray is scheduled to make his 2015 debut in the second game after going 1-3 with a 4.01 ERA in five starts for Triple-A Reno. The Diamondbacks would have had to make a roster move had Ray pitched Tuesday. However, with 26 players allowed on the roster for the second game of a doubleheader, adding Ray on Wednesday will not require a corresponding move.

STREAK: Lost three

PLAYER NOTES:
--RHP Josh Collmenter will start Wednesday on six days of rest after the Rockies and Diamondbacks were rained out Monday and Tuesday. He hopes his current success will stop the Diamondbacks' three-game losing streak. In winning two of his past three starts, Collmenter has conceded just three runs, one walk and 15 hits while striking out 11 in 23 innings.
--LHP Patrick Corbin, who underwent Tommy John surgery on March 25, 2014, threw 39 pitches and allowed no hits or walks in three innings in an extended spring training game at the Diamondbacks complex in Scottsdale, Ariz.
--RF Mark Trumbo was scheduled to bat second in a start Tuesday for the first time in his career. The Diamondbacks have lost three straight games and seven of their past nine, scoring 10 runs in the losses, and manager Chip Hale said he wanted to capitalize on Trumbo's success at Coors Field -- .294 (10-for-34) with seven homers and 17 RBIs in his career.
--RHP Archie Bradley (right sinus fracture) threw a side session Monday. He could start May 15 at Philadelphia.
--3B Jake Lamb (left foot stress reaction) had the boot removed from his foot Monday and could start treadmill walking.
--LHP Robbie Ray is scheduled to make his 2015 debut in the second game of Wednesday's doubleheader after going 1-3 with a 4.01 ERA in five starts for Triple-A Reno. The Diamondbacks would have had to make a roster move had Ray pitched Tuesday. However, with 26 players allowed on the roster for the second game of a doubleheader, adding Ray on Wednesday will not require a corresponding move.
