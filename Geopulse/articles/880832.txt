ATHENS Greece's anti-bailout Syriza party widened its lead over Prime Minister Antonis Samaras' conservatives ahead of a Jan. 25 snap election, a poll showed on Friday.
Alexis Tsipras' Syriza party led by 3.8 percentage points over Samaras' New Democracy party, the Rass survey conducted between Jan. 14 and 15 showed, up from 3 points in a poll conducted by the same company earlier this week.
