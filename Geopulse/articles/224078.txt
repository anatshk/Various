Fitch Affirms Russian Kemerovo Region at 'BB-'; Outlook Stable
(The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON/MOSCOW/FRANKFURT, October 23 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the  Russian Kemerovo Region's Long-term foreign and local currency Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs) at 'BB-' and its Short-term foreign currency IDR at 'B'. The  agency has also affirmed the region's National Long-term rating at 'A+(rus)'.  The Outlooks on the Long-term ratings are Stable. Fitch has also affirmed the region's senior unsecured debt at Long-term local  currency 'BB-' and at National Long-term 'A+(rus)'.  The affirmation reflects Fitch's unchanged base line scenario regarding the  region's marginally positive operating balance and gradually growing direct  risk, in line with the region's ratings. KEY RATING DRIVERS  The 'BB-' rating reflects the region's volatile budgetary performance and high  deficit before debt in 2012-2014 that led to rapid debt increase albeit from a  low base. The rating also reflects the region's undiversified economy with a  developed tax base that is exposed to the economic cycle, weak institutional  framework and our expectation of a stagnant local economy following the negative  national trend. Positively, the rating takes into account Kemerovo's low  contingent risk.  Fitch expects the region's operating balance to consolidate at low positive  values during 2015-2017, but the current balance to remain negative. Budgetary  performance will be underpinned by growth of tax proceeds due to improved  financials of mining and metallurgical companies, which are the largest  taxpayers in the region.  In 2014, the operating balance returned to positive territory, driven by a 50%  increase in transfers and modest recovery of corporate income tax. The latter  was driven by the improving earnings of local exporters following the  stabilisation of prices of key commodities and the depreciation of the rouble.  Fitch expects Kemerovo's direct risk to grow to 70%-75% of current revenue by  end-2017, which is still consistent with the region's ratings. We also expect  the deficit before debt to narrow due to cuts in capex limiting debt growth. The  wide deficit before debt during 2012-2014 had resulted in a rapid rise in direct  risk to RUB51bn (57% of current revenue) at end-2014, from RUB19bn (21%) in  2011.  Immediate refinancing risk is moderate; as at 1 October the region's debt  comprised 37% subsidised budget loans, which are likely to be rolled over by the  federal government. Another 48% direct risk is three-year bank loans. The  maturity profile of these budget and bank loans is distributed between 2015 and  2018, with moderate concentration in 2018.  The region's obligations/liabilities also include a long-term bank loan from  Vnesheconombank (VEB: BBB-/Negative/F3), which represented 12% of direct risk as  of 1 October 2015.  VEB extended credit facilities to private companies in the  1990s, which  Kemerovo assumed as an aggregated loan in the mid-2000s. The loan  is denominated in US dollars and exposes the region to unhedged foreign-currency  risk. The risk is, however, mitigated by a low 1% annual interest rate and the  long maturity to 1 January 2035, which takes the immediate pressure off the  region's debt servicing burden. Kemerovo has low contingent risk stemming from public sector entities' financial  debt and issued guarantees. In late 2011, the region imposed a moratorium on new  guarantees issuance and as of 1 October 2015 the region had no outstanding  guarantees. The region has a concentrated economy weighted towards coal mining and ferrous  metallurgy. This provides an extensive tax base for the region's budget,  accounting for 79% of operating revenue in 2014. However, this also means a  large portion of the region's tax revenues depends on companies' profits,  resulting in high revenue volatility through the economic cycle given its less  diversified profile. Kemerovo demonstrated close to zero GRP growth in real terms in 2014, following  the deterioration of the national economic environment.  RATING SENSITIVITIES An improvement in the operating balance to 6%-8% of operating revenue and  maintenance of a debt payback ratio (direct risk to current balance) below 10  years on a sustainable base could lead to an upgrade. The inability to maintain a positive operating balance on a sustained basis or  an increase in direct risk above 90% of current revenue could lead to a  downgrade.
