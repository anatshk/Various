Fitch Affirms ING Bank's Baht Bonds at 'AAA(tha)'
(The following statement was released by the rating agency) BANGKOK/HONG KONG, June 16 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings (Thailand) has affirmed ING  Bank NV's (ING Bank) THB4&@&26bn senior unsecured bonds due 2016 at 'AAA(tha)'.  This follows the recent downgrade of ING Bank's Long-Term Foreign Currency  Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'A'/Stable from 'A+'/Negative on 19 May 2015 (see  "Fitch Takes Action on Dutch Banks on Sovereign Support Review" on  www. fitchratings. com) KEY RATING DRIVERS  The rating of the bonds is based on ING Bank's Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR of  'A', which is still higher than Thailand's Long-Term Local Currency IDR of 'A-'.  Hence, the rating on the bonds remains at 'AAA(tha)', the highest rating on  Thailand's National rating scale.  The downgrade of ING Bank's Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR was driven by the  revision of its Support Rating Floor (SRF) to 'No Floor' from 'A+'. The action  was taken in conjunction with Fitch's recent review of sovereign support for  banks globally. Fitch believes legislative, regulatory and policy initiatives  have substantially reduced the likelihood of sovereign support for US, Swiss and  European Union commercial banks. Fitch believes that extraordinary external  support, while possible, can no longer be relied upon for Dutch Banks.   As a result of the revision to the SRF, the IDR of ING Bank is now driven by its  standalone creditworthiness as expressed by the Viability Rating (VR).  ING Bank's VR reflects the bank's strong franchise and diverse business model  (mostly in the Benelux region), which supports resilient earnings generation,  and its balanced funding profile. The VR also factors in the bank's moderate  impaired loans and modest coverage ratios, which result in a higher proportion  of unreserved impaired loans relative to its equity base than similarly rated  peers. ING Bank is the largest Dutch bank by total assets; it has a strong retail and  commercial banking franchise in the Benelux. It also has retail banking  operations outside the Benelux in a number of countries, notably through its  direct banking business ING Direct, and commercial banking activities are  conducted in major global financial centres. RATING SENSITIVITIES The 'AAA(tha)' rating on ING Bank's bonds is the highest on the national scale  and, hence, no rating upside is possible. The downgrade of the baht-denominated bond's rating is unlikely in the  short-term as ING Bank's Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR is still one notch  higher than Thailand's Long-Term Local Currency IDR. Moreover, the Stable  Outlooks on the ratings on ING Bank and Thailand indicated that the ratings of  the two entities are not expected to change in the short-term. ING Bank's other ratings are not affected and are as follows: Long-Term IDR: 'A'; Outlook Stable  Short-Term IDR: 'F1' Viability Rating: 'a' Support Rating: '5'  Support Rating Floor: 'No Floor'  Subordinated debt: 'A-' Senior unsecured notes: 'A'/'F1'  Short-term senior unsecured notes: 'F1'  Commercial paper: 'A'/'F1' Market linked notes (XS1144264667, XS1170271479, XS1202919806): 'A(emr)'  Contacts: Primary Analyst Patchara Sarayudh (ING Bank's THB bonds) Director  +662 108 0152  Fitch Ratings (Thailand) Limited Park Ventures, Level 17 57 Wireless Road, Lumpini Patumwan, Bangkok 10330 Secondary Analyst (ING Bank's THB bonds) Jindarat Laotaveerungsawat Associate Director +662 108 0153  Committee Chairperson (ING Bank's THB bonds) Jonathan Cornish Managing Director +852 2263 9901 Primary Analyst Jens Hallen (ING Bank) Senior Director +44 20 3530 1326  Fitch Ratings Limited 30 North Colonnade London E14 5GN Bjorn Norrman (ING Bank) Director +44 20 3530 1330 Media Relations: Leslie Tan, Singapore, Tel: +65 67 96 7234, Email:  leslie. tan@fitchratings. com. Note to Editors: Fitch's National ratings provide a relative measure of  creditworthiness for rated entities in countries with relatively low  international sovereign ratings and where there is demand for such ratings. The  best risk within a country is rated 'AAA' and other credits are rated only  relative to this risk. National ratings are designed for use mainly by local  investors in local markets and are signified by the addition of an identifier  for the country concerned, such as 'AAA(tha)' for National ratings in Thailand.  Specific letter grades are not therefore internationally comparable.
