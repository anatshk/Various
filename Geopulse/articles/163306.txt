SEC fines high-speed trading firm Latour for rule violations
NEW YORK, Sept 30 The U&-&S&-& Securities and Exchange Commission said on Wednesday that high-frequency trading firm Latour Trading LLC would pay more than $8 million to settle charges with the regulator that it violated rules aimed at ensuring safe and efficient markets.
Latour, a unit of Tower Research, did not admit or deny to the charges that it sent out millions of non-compliant orders to U&-&S&-& stock exchanges, many of which were executed at worse prices than were available elsewhere, over a nearly four-year period, the SEC said.
