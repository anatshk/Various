CHICAGO -- Even as Carlos Correa, the No&*& 1 overall pick in the 2012 draft, made his major league debut Monday, the Houston Astros added another prospect at his position.
Houston went with Louisiana State shortstop Alex Bregman as the No&*& 2 overall pick. The Astros also selected Kyle Tucker, a high school outfielder from Tampa, Fla&*&, at No&*& 5 overall.
Bregman, who is from Albuquerque, N&-&M&-&, hit a two-run single in the eighth inning Sunday to help the Tigers to a 6-3 victory over Louisiana-Lafayette that secured their second trip to the College World Series in three seasons.
Bregman is hitting &#&312 with a &#&406 on-base percentage, nine homers and 49 RBIs in 63 games during his junior season at LSU. He is one of four finalists for the Golden Spikes award that goes to the best player in college baseball.
The Astros got the second pick as compensation for not signing the 2014 No&*& 1 overall selection, left-hander Brady Aiken, who was chosen 17th Monday by the Cleveland Indians.
Tucker, the younger brother of current Astros outfielder Preston Tucker, is lefty-hitting outfielder from H&-&B&-& Plant High School.
He batted &#&484 with 10 home runs, 27 RBIs and 29 runs in his senior year and was named the 2014-15 Gatorade Florida Baseball Player of the Year.
In addition to the two top-five choices, Houston had two other selections Monday.
Daz Cameron, the 18-year-old son of former major-leaguer Mike Cameron, went as the No&*& 37 pick in the Competitive Balance A round. He is an outfielder from Eagle's Landing Christian Academy in McDonough, Ga&*&
The Astros' second-round pick was Cal State-Fullerton right-hander Thomas Eshelman, selected at No&*& 46. The junior got a save Monday in a 4-3, 11-inning win over Louisville that put the Titans in the College World Series. It was his first relief appearance of the season.
Through 18 games (17 starts), Eshelman is 8-5 with a 1&@&58 ERA. He has 131 strikeouts in 131 1/3 innings.
The draft continues with rounds three through 10 on Tuesday and additional rounds on Wednesday.
Correa, the overall No&*& 1 selection in the 2012 draft, started at shortstop as the Astros opened a three-game series in Chicago against the White Sox, and he went 1-for-4 with an RBI single.
