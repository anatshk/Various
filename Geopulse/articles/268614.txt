LONDON, Sept 9 Britain's top stock index rallied on Wednesday for a third straight session, boosted by encouraging corporate news from mining companies and financial firms and gains in Asian markets.
The market ignored a report that UK manufacturing output fell in July, since it makes an interest rate increase by the Bank of England less likely&$&.I don't think this miss in manufacturing production is that much of a big surprise," said Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at GAIN Capital, adding that he expected trading to be subdued before the Bank of England's latest meeting, which ends on Thursday.
The FTSE 100 index was up 2&@&0 percent at 6,269&@&20 points at 1351 GMT, still around 12 percent off April's record high, after uncertainty over China's growth roiled markets in August.
The FTSE 350 mining sector index was up 5&@&1 percent, extending the previous session's rise of 2&@&6 percent.
The rally in mining shares followed a rebound by Chinese stocks on Wednesday, which reached a three-week high on hopes of further government stimulus. China is a major consumer of minerals&$&.The rally we are seeing is a bit of a relief rally &;&. A bounce-back was long overdue," said GAIN Capital's Razaqzada.
Anglo American jumped 7&@&5 percent, one of the biggest gains on the FTSE 100. Its Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) unit sold labour-intensive South African mines to Sibanye Gold for 4&@&5 billion rand ($331 million) to focus on newer, mechanised mines&$&.We feel this is a good result for Anglo and clearly shows that the management team at both Amplats and Anglo American are delivering on promises made," analysts at Investec said in a note.
Asset manager Hargreaves Lansdown was another top performer, rising 5&@&7 percent after reporting a surge in full-year assets, despite forecast-lagging profit and revenue.
The index's top loser was easyJet, down 1&@&5 percent, giving up all its earlier gains after a conference call by competitor Ryanair. One trader said easyJet's numbers looked lacklustre compared with Ryanair's.
Drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline suffered, falling almost 1 percent. The company and its partner, Theravance Inc, said their inhaled medicine Breo failed to prolong life for patients with chronic respiratory disease in a clinical trial.
Among small-cap stocks, Monitise shares plummeted 47 percent. The chief of the British mobile-banking software company quit after just over a year in the post.
