MLB Team Report - San Diego Padres - INSIDE PITCH
Padres' Upton sits, but DL seems unlikely
MILWAUKEE -- Less than an hour remained before first pitch when San Diego Padres interim manager Pat Murphy finally posted his lineup and held the customary pregame session with the media.
The delay wasn't a result of chicanery; Murphy was trying to wait as long as possible to know for sure whether or not left fielder Justin Upton would be available Tuesday night at Milwaukee.
Ultimately, Upton sat out against the Brewers, still nursing a sore thumb that he banged into a railing down the left field line Monday night&$&.I think he's close," said Murphy, who said he didn't think Upton would need time on the disabled list&$&.I think the throwing's more of an issue than the swinging right now&$&.
Acquired in a December trade with the Braves, Upton has appeared in 100 games for San Diego this season, batting &#&247 with 18 home runs and 57 RBIs&*&
