UPDATE 2-Norfolk Southern rejects Canadian Pacific's revised offer
(Adds details)
Dec 14 U&-&S&-& railroad operator Norfolk Southern Corp formally rejected a revised offer from Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd, raising the prospect of a proxy battle.
CP shareholder Bill Ackman said last week that CP Chief Executive Hunter Harrison and he have both been sounded out by activists interested in a proxy fight with Norfolk Southern.
Ackman and Harrison also said if necessary they will take the proposed merger directly to shareholders.
Ackman's hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, holds 9&@&12 percent of CP, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Norfolk Southern said on Monday the revised offer was worth less than CP's earlier proposal.
The revised offer valued Norfolk Southern at $88&@&52 per share, based on CP stock's closing price on Friday, Norfolk Southern said.
At that price, the revised offer valued Norfolk Southern at $26&@&8 billion. CP's original proposal was worth $28&@&4 billion.
Norfolk Southern's shares closed at $89&@&44 on Friday. They were trading up 1 percent at $90&@&50 in early trading on Monday.
CP's proposal "continues to be grossly inadequate" and "nothing in the revised, reduced proposal addresses the concerns of the Norfolk Southern board," the company said in a letter disclosed in a regulatory filing.
CP made its offer for Norfolk Southern public on Nov&*& 17, valuing the company at about $94&@&94 per share, but met with an unenthusiastic response.
CP first offered $46&@&72 in cash and 0&@&348 of its shares for every Norfolk share.
In the revised bid, CP slashed the cash component to $32&@&86 and offered 0&@&451 of a share in a new holding company that would own both Norfolk Southern and CP.
Norfolk Southern has also highlighted that the merger was unlikely to win approval from U&-&S&-& regulators.
CP's shares were down marginally at C$168&@&77 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
