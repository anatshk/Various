Palantir Technologies raises $880 million from investors
By Heather Somerville | SAN FRANCISCO
SAN FRANCISCO Palantir Technologies, a data analytics and security company that helps government agencies track down terrorists and uncover financial fraud, said on Wednesday it has raised $880 million in its latest financing round.
Earlier this month, the Palo Alto, California-based company reported that the funding round, which started in July, had raised $679&@&8 million. Wednesday's filing indicates it raised an additional $200 million in just weeks.
Founded in 2004, Palantir, which is considered Silicon Valley's most secretive company, does highly confidential work for U&-&S&-& defense and intelligence agencies. Its data mining system, which uses algorithms to search for patterns and connections, helped the U&-&S&-& government track down al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
The company's large staff of consultants also work with large businesses, police departments, banks and branches of the U&-&S&-& military.
Palantir has raised close to $2 billion from investors.   Its valuation earlier this month reached $20 billion, up from $15 billion in late 2014, making it the fourth-highest-valued, venture-backed private tech company in the world.
The company has bucked growing skepticism among late-stage investors about plowing millions into highly valuable companies. Other "unicorns," or venture-backed companies ostensibly worth $1 billion or more, have watched their valuations come under heightened scrutiny.
Palantir's strong government ties and an annual revenue estimated by some at more about $1 billion likely set it apart from other cash-burning startups. The company was co-founded by Peter Thiel and Joe Lonsdale, two of Silicon Valley's more influential investors and entrepreneurs.
