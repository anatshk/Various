Millennium Health seeks bankruptcy after overbilling settlement
WILMINGTON, Del Nov 10 Millennium Health, formerly Millennium Laboratories, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Tuesday, a month after it agreed to pay $256 million to settle allegations it overbilled federal healthcare programs such as Medicare, according to court documents.
Millennium, one of the largest U&-&S&-& urine drug testing laboratories, said it was planning to use its bankruptcy to implement a debt-cutting deal. That agreement would reduce its obligations under a 2014 credit agreement to $600 million from $1&@&75 billion. Those creditors would also receive ownership of the company when it emerges from bankruptcy.
