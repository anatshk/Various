HONG KONG, June 30 Asian shares rose on Tuesday after Chinese stocks broke a punishing three-day losing streak, but gains were capped by fears they could go into freefall again and as investors nervously awaited further developments in the deepening euro zone crisis.
With a Greek debt default feared within hours and wild  volatility in China, European stocks markets were expected to extend Monday's losses and few players were willing to buy the euro common currency.

Volatility in China's stock market in recent days has rippled through Asia, weighing on stock markets from Mumbai to Australia, and prompting investors to rush to the sidelines.

Over the weekend, China cut interest rates and lowered reserve requirements to stabilise markets - a rare combination not seen since the depths of the 2008 financial crisis. In fresh steps, authorities are also preparing to allow pension funds to invest in the stock market for the first time.
Notwithstanding the flurry of measures taken by Beijing, high-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar  remained out of favour as investors sought refuge from the heightened market volatility in safe-haven assets.
