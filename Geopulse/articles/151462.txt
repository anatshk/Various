Russian minister says met IAAF's Coe over sports doping allegations - R-Sport
MOSCOW Nov 23 Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said on Monday he had met Sebastian Coe, the head of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), to discuss doping allegations against Russian athletes, R-Sport reported.
Mutko said a first meeting of an IAAF commission looking into the issue with Russian officials would take place in December.
He also said it was possible that the second part of a report by a commission from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) would also single Russia out for criticism, but said Russia was "legally" ready for such an eventuality.
