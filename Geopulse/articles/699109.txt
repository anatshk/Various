Cenovus says will divest royalty lands when values right
CALGARY, Alberta, April 29 Cenovus Energy Inc  will sell or spin off its wholly-owned oil and gas lands when it believes market value for the properties meet its expectations, Chief executive Brian Ferguson said on Wednesday.
Speaking on a conference call to discuss its first-quarter earnings, Ferguson also said Cenovus, Canada's No.2 independent oil producer, does not want a variable dividend and current commodity prices are sufficient to cover both 2015 capital spending and its dividend payout.
