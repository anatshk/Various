MLB Team Report - Tampa Bay Rays - INSIDE PITCH
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The Tampa Bay Rays lead the majors with 18 saves, and their stellar relief continued Thursday night when four relievers each pitched a scoreless inning in a 3-0 win over the Oakland Athletics.
"The bullpen, they've been consistent all year -- they've been outstanding," manager Kevin Cash said.
The healthy return of last year's closer, Jake McGee, completed a dominating 1-2-3 punch for the final three innings, with right-hander Kevin Jepsen, left-hander McGee and right-hander Brad Boxberger closing the door on many close wins.
Tampa Bay's bullpen has a 1.84 ERA since April 19 while holding opposing batters to a .186 batting average. Boxberger is 12-for-12 on save opportunities, and he held the opponent scoreless in his each of his past 11 appearances. The relievers combined for six strikeouts Thursday, including two each from McGee and Boxberger. Right-hander Steve Geltz, Jepsen, McGee and Boxberger allowed only two hits and one walk to the 14 batters they faced.
Strong relief pitching is helping the Rays turn things around at Tropicana Field, where they opened the season 1-5 but are 12-5 since, including four consecutive wins.

--DH David DeJesus continued his strong hitting, as his RBI double and solo homer accounted for two of the Rays' three runs. DeJesus is batting .324 and has 18 RBIs on the season, the team's best average and tied for the most RBIs.
--RF Steven Souza continues to struggle with strikeouts, as he whiffed four times in four at-bats Thursday night. He has a team-high 62 K's in 142 at-bats this season. He leads the team with six home runs but must lower his strikeout totals.
--LHP Jake McGee is off to a strong start since returning from elbow surgery. He has a 0.00 ERA after three games. On Thursday, he struck out two of the three batters he faced in a perfect eighth inning, part of a dominating night for the Rays bullpen.
--RHP Brad Boxberger is a perfect 12-for-12 on save opportunities after pitching a scoreless ninth Thursday. He gave up two singles but stranded both runners, getting a strikeout to end the game and clinch the 3-0 win over Oakland.
--LHP Matt Moore will throw two innings in extended spring training Saturday morning. He is recovering from Tommy John surgery performed in April 2014.
QUOTE TO NOTE: "You want to be in this position at the end of the year. It's always nice to be here where we're at ... but I don't think we'll get too caught up in where we're at at this given point. We just want to play good baseball." -- Manager Kevin Cash, after the Rays grabbed sole possession of first place in the American League East with a 3-0 win over the A's on Thursday.
