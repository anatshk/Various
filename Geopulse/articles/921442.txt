U.S. stock index futures were higher on Thursday, a day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the 20,000 milestone for the first time.
* The 42-session surge from the Dow's first close above 19,000 marks the second-shortest length of time between such milestones.
* The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite indexes also closed at record highs for the second consecutive session on Wednesday.
* The post-election rally roared back to life following optimism over U.S. President Donald Trump's pro-growth initiatives and a string of solid earnings reports.
* Trump's business-friendly decisions since taking office on Friday include signing executive orders to reduce regulatory burden on domestic manufacturers and clearing the way for the construction of two oil pipelines.
* Earnings are expected to rise 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter, their biggest increase in two years. Of the 104 S&P 500 companies that have reported results so far, nearly 70 percent have topped expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
* PayPal (PYPL.O) and Caterpillar (CAT.N) are scheduled to report before market opens, while tech giants Intel (INTC.O), Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) report after the close.

* The Commerce Department will release U.S. single-family home sales numbers for December that is expected to have dipped slightly from the previous month. The report is expected at 10 a.m. ET
* Oil prices were higher, driven up by a weakening dollar, though gains were capped by plentiful supplies and bulging inventories despite efforts by OPEC and other producers to cut output to prop up the market.
* Biogen (BIIB.O) shares fell 5.7 percent to $257.72 in premarket trading after the drugmaker's quarterly profit fell 22 percent.
* EBay (EBAY.O) jumped 6.5 percent to $32.20, a day after the e-commerce company reported a rise in revenue for the fourth-quarter holiday period.
* Whirlpool (WHR.N) fell 1.1 percent to $188.05 after the world's largest maker of home appliances posted a quarterly profit that came in below expectations.
