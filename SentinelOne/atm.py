Python ATM Exam:

You will write an ATM (Automatic Teller Machine) in Python.
It will work as follows.
When run, the user will be displayed with a menu:

1. Login
2. Quit

If the user selects 1, he will be prompted to enter a password.
If the password is correct, the user will log in.
The ATM supports several users. There is no username.
Instead, a user is identified only through a unique password.
If the user selects "Quit", the application will exit

After a user has logged in, the following menu will appear:

1. Check Balance
2. Deposit
3. Withdraw
4. Logoff


The following describes the supported actions:

* Check Balance - Displays the current balance in the userâ€™s account
* Deposit       - Prompts the user for an amount of money to deposit.
                  Increases the balance with the amount provided
* Withdraw      - Prompts the user to specify an amount of money to withdraw
                  from the account.
                  If the account has an empty balance, disallow the transaction
* Logout        - Logs out the current user and returns to the original
                  login menu

When implementing this exercise,
here are a few things to take into consideration:
Try to clearly separate classes to clear units of responsibility.
Properly abstract the code. Bad user input shouldn't cause the
application to terminate

Useful resources:
* Python Tutorial

I recommend using the standard Python development environment found on python.org

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
